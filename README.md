# BSTree
This repo contains A C++ implementation of a Binary Search Tree

3 files that need to be compiled, BSTree.cpp, BSTreeNode.cpp, and main.cpp

main.cpp is the driver code for this project, and a new feature was added
that lets the user specify what values they would like in the Tree through main.cpp.
